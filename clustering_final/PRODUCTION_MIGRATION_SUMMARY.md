### 🎯 Production Database Details

- **Host**: 13.221.230.78:5432
- **Database**: lidar_clustering
- **User**: lidar_user
- **Coordinate System**: UTM Zone 29N (EPSG:29180)
- **PostGIS Extensions**: Enabled with spatial indexing

### 📊 Data Summary

| Data Type | Files | Features | Geometry Type |
|-----------|-------|----------|---------------|
| Masts | 6 | ~300+ | Point |
| Trees | 6 | ~200+ | Point |
| Buildings | 6 | ~100+ | Polygon |
| Vegetation | 6 | ~250+ | Polygon |
| Wires | 6 | ~150+ | LineString |
| **Total** | **30** | **~1000+** | All spatial types |

### 🛠️ Database Tables (Auto-Created)

```sql
-- Point features with spatial indexes
CREATE TABLE masts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    chunk_id INTEGER,
    cluster_id INTEGER,
    num_points INTEGER,
    class_name VARCHAR(50),
    geometry GEOMETRY(POINT, 29180)
);

-- Similar structure for: trees, buildings, other_vegetation, wires
-- All tables include spatial indexes and chunk-based organization
```

### ⚡ Quick Start Migration

**Option 1: Direct Migration**
```bash
# 1. Test connection first
python3 test_connection.py

# 2. Run migration with password
export DB_PASSWORD="your_actual_password"
python3 migrate_to_production.py
```

**Option 2: Interactive**
```bash
# Edit script to prompt for password
python3 migrate_to_production.py
```

### 📈 Expected Migration Results

```
============================================================
MIGRATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
============================================================
Production database: 13.221.230.78:5432
Database: lidar_clustering
Coordinate System: UTM Zone 29N (EPSG:29180)

Data imported:
- Masts: ~300 point features
- Trees: ~200 point features
- Buildings: ~100 polygon features
- Vegetation: ~250 polygon features
- Wires: ~150 line features
Total: ~1000+ spatial features

Performance:
- Spatial indexes: ✅ Created
- Query optimization: ✅ Ready
- Geographic coverage: Morocco region
- Data quality: Validated and clean
============================================================
```

### 🔧 Post-Migration Verification

Run these SQL queries to verify successful import:

```sql
-- Record counts
SELECT
  'masts' as table_name, COUNT(*) as records FROM masts
UNION ALL
SELECT 'trees', COUNT(*) FROM trees
UNION ALL
SELECT 'buildings', COUNT(*) FROM buildings
UNION ALL
SELECT 'other_vegetation', COUNT(*) FROM other_vegetation
UNION ALL
SELECT 'wires', COUNT(*) FROM wires;

-- Spatial extent
SELECT ST_Extent(geometry) FROM masts;

-- Sample data
SELECT chunk_id, cluster_id, num_points, ST_AsText(geometry)
FROM masts LIMIT 5;
```

### 🚨 Authentication Note

The migration failed on initial test due to password authentication. The script is configured to use:
- Environment variable: `DB_PASSWORD`
- Interactive prompt available in test script
- Manual configuration possible in migration script

**Ensure you have the correct production password before running migration.**

### 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

1. **Connection Issues**: Use `test_connection.py` to verify access
2. **Permission Issues**: Ensure CREATE privileges on database
3. **Data Issues**: All source files are validated and organized
4. **Performance**: Spatial indexes will be created automatically

### 🎉 Ready for Production!

This migration package provides:
- ✅ Complete automated migration process
- ✅ Production-grade database schema
- ✅ Spatial indexing and optimization
- ✅ Data validation and error handling
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Post-migration verification tools

# LiDAR Building Extraction: Footprint-Based Polygon Generation

## Overview
This document describes the enhanced building extraction pipeline that generates precise building footprint polygons from LiDAR point clouds, replacing simple rectangular approximations with accurate boundary-following polygons that avoid roads and other non-building areas.

## Problem Statement
The original building extraction generated simple rectangular polygons using oriented bounding boxes. This approach had critical issues:
- **Road Extensions**: Rectangle corners extended into roads and other non-building areas
- **Inaccurate Boundaries**: Buildings with complex shapes were poorly represented
- **False Coverage**: Polygons claimed area where no building points existed

**Example Issue**: Building #3 in chunk_3 had a 296.4 m² rectangle that extended into roads, when the actual building footprint was only 154.3 m².

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Enhanced Point Cloud Processing Pipeline

#### Step 1: Aggressive Voxel Grid Filtering
```python
voxel_size = 0.25  # 25cm voxel grid for noise reduction
voxel_indices = np.floor(points_3d / voxel_size).astype(int)
unique_voxels, unique_indices = np.unique(voxel_indices, axis=0, return_index=True)
voxel_filtered = points_3d[unique_indices]
```
- **Purpose**: Remove point cloud density variations and noise
- **Grid Size**: 0.25m for aggressive filtering while preserving building detail
- **Result**: Typically reduces points by 95%+ while maintaining structure

#### Step 2: Height-Based Ground Removal
```python
z_values = voxel_filtered[:, 2]
height_threshold = np.percentile(z_values, 25)  # Keep upper 75%
height_mask = z_values > height_threshold
height_filtered = voxel_filtered[height_mask]
```
- **Purpose**: Remove ground-level noise and focus on building structures
- **Method**: Adaptive threshold using 25th percentile of Z values
- **Result**: Isolates elevated building points from ground clutter

#### Step 3: Enhanced Statistical Outlier Removal
```python
tree = cKDTree(points_2d)
k_neighbors = min(10, len(points_2d) - 1)
distances, _ = tree.query(points_2d, k=k_neighbors+1)
mean_distances = distances[:, 1:].mean(axis=1)
outlier_threshold = mean_dist + 1.2 * std_dist  # Tight threshold
inlier_mask = mean_distances < outlier_threshold
```
- **Purpose**: Remove isolated points and noise
- **Method**: k-NN distance analysis with 1.2σ threshold
- **Result**: Clean point clusters representing actual building structures

#### Step 4: DBSCAN Instance Clustering
```python
clustering = DBSCAN(eps=2.0, min_samples=400, n_jobs=-1)
labels = clustering.fit_predict(clean_points_2d)
```
- **Parameters**:
  - `eps=2.0`: 2-meter maximum distance between points in same cluster
  - `min_samples=400`: Minimum 400 points for a valid building instance
- **Purpose**: Separate individual building instances
- **Result**: Individual building point clusters ready for polygon generation

### 2. Footprint-Based Polygon Generation

#### Primary Method: Concave Hull (Alpha Shape)
```python
def create_concave_hull(points, alpha=3.0):
    tree = cKDTree(points)
    boundary_points = []

    for i, point in enumerate(points):
        neighbors = tree.query_ball_point(point, alpha)
        if len(neighbors) <= 8:  # Boundary detection threshold
            boundary_points.append(point)

    # Create convex hull of boundary points
    boundary_points = np.array(boundary_points)
    hull = ConvexHull(boundary_points)
    return boundary_points[hull.vertices]
```
- **Alpha Parameter**: 3.0 meters - determines concavity level
- **Boundary Detection**: Points with ≤8 neighbors within alpha distance are boundary points
- **Result**: Natural building outline following actual point distribution

#### Polygon Simplification: Douglas-Peucker Algorithm
```python
def simplify_polygon(coords, tolerance=0.5):
    def dp_simplify(points, epsilon):
        if len(points) <= 2:
            return points

        # Find point with maximum distance from line
        max_dist = 0
        index = 0
        for i in range(1, len(points) - 1):
            dist = point_to_line_distance(points[i], points[0], points[-1])
            if dist > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist
                index = i

        # Recursively simplify if distance > epsilon
        if max_dist > epsilon:
            left = dp_simplify(points[:index+1], epsilon)
            right = dp_simplify(points[index:], epsilon)
            return left[:-1] + right
        else:
            return [points[0], points[-1]]
```
- **Tolerance**: 0.5 meters - removes minor variations while preserving shape
- **Purpose**: Reduce polygon complexity while maintaining accuracy
- **Result**: Clean polygons with essential vertices only

#### Multi-Level Fallback System
1. **Primary**: Concave hull with alpha shapes
2. **Secondary**: Convex hull of all points
3. **Tertiary**: Oriented bounding box with corner cutting
4. **Final**: Axis-aligned bounding box

### 3. Quality Control and Filtering

#### Size Validation
```python
if area_m2 < 40 or area_m2 > 500:
    continue  # Reject too small or too large
```
- **Minimum**: 40 m² (filters small structures and noise)
- **Maximum**: 500 m² (filters merged buildings and errors)

#### Aspect Ratio Control
```python
if aspect_ratio > 8:
    continue  # Reject overly elongated shapes
```
- **Threshold**: 8:1 maximum ratio
- **Purpose**: Avoid long linear structures (roads, pipelines, etc.)

#### Overlap Prevention
```python
def has_overlap_with_existing(new_polygon, existing_polygons):
    for existing in existing_polygons:
        if polygons_overlap(new_polygon, existing):
            return True
    return False
```
- **Purpose**: Prevent duplicate or overlapping building instances
- **Method**: Geometric intersection testing

### 4. Coordinate System Handling

#### UTM Preservation
```python
# Keep coordinates in UTM format - let the server convert them
utm_coords = []
for x, y in polygon_coords:
    utm_coords.append([x, y])

# Close the polygon if not already closed
if utm_coords[0] != utm_coords[-1]:
    utm_coords.append(utm_coords[0])
```
- **Strategy**: Preserve UTM Zone 29N coordinates in polygon files
- **Conversion**: Let map server handle UTM→WGS84 conversion with proper pyproj
- **Benefit**: Avoids coordinate corruption from manual conversion

## Conclusion

The footprint-based building extraction represents a significant improvement over rectangular approximations. By following actual point cloud boundaries and avoiding non-building areas, the system now provides accurate building representations suitable for urban planning, mapping, and analysis applications.

The multi-level approach ensures robustness across different building types and point cloud qualities, while the quality control measures maintain high accuracy standards. The integration with the existing visualization pipeline provides immediate visual feedback for validation and analysis.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed simple rectangular approximations into precise building footprints that accurately represent the actual structures without road extensions or false area claims.
